I"º<p>Donâ€™t fear AP CS! Iâ€™ve been teaching this class since 2005, so I know the ins and outs of the course material and exam. Iâ€™ll help you think like College Board question writers to take control of your test-taking, Iâ€™ll give you extra practice problems, and together weâ€™ll work through those tricky assignments that your teachers throw at you. Iâ€™ll also help you break down fundamental concepts that are crucial for the course, exam, and your overall coding knowledge. Iâ€™ve worked with several clients in the past throughout the school year on an as-needed basis.</p>
