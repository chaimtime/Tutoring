I"ª<p>Here are other topics I can help with. I am very good at college planning, specifically choosing courses to focus on prior to attending a 4 year university. While my experience is NJ community college to Rutgers University, the ideas are all the same. I am also a certified Math teacher. I can help if you need a refresher in a topic.</p>
