I"±<p>I started tutoring to help those who became completely lost. If you need last minute help, I will do my best to help. While Iâ€™m experienced at Java, I am good at problem solving. If you give me some syntax to work with, I can usually figure out other languages.</p>

<p>I will not do your homework for you. I will make you think of the solution, and do your best to learn the material.</p>
