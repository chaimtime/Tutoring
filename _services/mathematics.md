Here are other topics I can help with. I am very good at college planning, specifically choosing courses to focus on prior to attending a 4 year university. While my experience is NJ community college to Rutgers University, the ideas are all the same. I am also a certified Math teacher. I can help if you need a refresher in a topic.

# College Ideas
1. How to see course equivalencies
2. Which courses to focus on
3. Which colleges to choose.


# Topics
1. Algebra 1
2. Algebra 2
3. Geometry
4. Statistics
5. SAT Math
6. College Math
