Don't fear AP CS! I've been teaching this class since 2005, so I know the ins and outs of the course material and exam. I'll help you think like College Board question writers to take control of your test-taking, I'll give you extra practice problems, and together we'll work through those tricky assignments that your teachers throw at you. I'll also help you break down fundamental concepts that are crucial for the course, exam, and your overall coding knowledge. I've worked with several clients in the past throughout the school year on an as-needed basis.
