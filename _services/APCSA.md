AP Computer Science A is an introductory course in Java. Just like any AP course the goal of the AP course is to prepare you to pass the AP Test in Java. If you want to learn Java, find a different course. The AP test's job is to get you to second guess yourself. The ideas are easy, but AP does their best to trick you.

# How I can help
I've worked with previous clients over the year to help them study and complete programs on as needed basis. I can assist in the assignments given by the teacher. <br>

I've worked with clients on reviewing introductory topics in preparation for AP.

I can help you think like AP does to do better on the test.

I can give you practice AP questions per unit as more practice

# Individual Tests

I have practice problems for individual units, both multiple choice and open ended. 

Please understand that each teacher teaches differently. Last minute test prep without understanding teacher requirements is very challenging.
