Don't fear AP CS! I've been teaching this class since 2005, so I know the ins and outs of the course material and exam. I'll help you think like College Board question writers to take control of your test-taking, I'll give you extra practice problems, and together we'll work through those tricky assignments that your teachers throw at you. I'll also help you break down fundamental concepts that are crucial for the course, exam, and your overall coding knowledge. I've worked with several clients in the past throughout the school year on an as-needed basis. 

## Topics
1. Classes and Objects
2. Conditionals
3. Iterations
4. Arrays / Array Lists
5. 2D Arrays
6. Algorithms and Efficiency
7. Sorting and Searching
8. Polymorphism and Inheritance
9. Interfaces (Not Tested but important)
10. Recursion

# How I can help
I've worked with previous clients over the year to help them study and complete programs on as needed basis. I can assist in the assignments given by the teacher. <br>

I've worked with clients on reviewing introductory topics in preparation for AP.

I can help you think like AP does to do better on the test.

I can give you practice AP questions per unit as more practice

# Individual Tests

I have practice problems for individual units, both multiple choice and open ended. 

Please understand that each teacher teaches differently. Last minute test prep without understanding teacher requirements is very challenging.
